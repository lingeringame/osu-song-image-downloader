# osu-song-image-downloader
Tool that downloads all background images and songs from beatmaps

###
osu! SBD is a small project I did on my free time. It's main purpose is to download all songs and/or background images from your beatmaps from your local osu! game 
folder. Currently it supports 8 types of images and 1 type of audio files, but when I am done with school I will tweak it a bit more if needed and add additional 
supporting types. 

I did this using python at first but I figured it would be nicer to have a user interface. My main motivation was that the music I was exposed to while 
playing osu! was one of the best and same with the wallpapers. I know the majority of the playerbase has hundreds if not thousands of beatmaps downloaded so this tool 
downloads all of that good stuff in mere seconds to your desired folder.
